Steps:
1. The data should be available as seurat/data/*_labelled.RDS 
##CMD: snakemake -np --use-conda --cores 30 (dry run)
##CMD: snakemake -p  --use-conda --cores 30 (actual run)
2. It can run either a list of single objects/integrated objects
3. Config file must be edited before starting the run

Improvemnts to make::

instead of class class_seurat
glia and neuron names inn ref to be explicitly checked: Apart from default get username

1. Conda pacakges yaml can be added in env to make it portable after testing
2. Can give only the same cutoff for top and bottom but that can be variable between glia and neuron
3. silence lib messages
4. The filtered, clustered and QCed objects are saved separately for tweaking the different steps individually. Can be combined as well
5. Plots are kept separately as well
